// Write a Java program to create a class called "BankAccount" with attributes for account number, account holder's name, and balance. Include methods for depositing and withdrawing money, as well as checking the balance. Create a subclass called "SavingsAccount" that adds an interest rate attribute and a method to apply interest.

public class SavingsAccount extends BankAccount {
    private double interestRate;

    public SavingsAccount(String accountName, String accountNumber, double interestRate) {
        super(accountName, accountNumber);
        this.interestRate = interestRate;
    }

    public void applyInterest() {
        double interest = balance * interestRate / 100;
        balance += interest;
        System.out.println("Interest added: " + interest);
    }
}
