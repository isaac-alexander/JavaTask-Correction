// 23. Write a Java program to create a class called "Course" with attributes for course name, instructor, and credits. Create a subclass "OnlineCourse" that adds attributes for platform and duration. Implement methods to display course details and check if the course is eligible for a certificate based on duration.

public class Course {

    private String courseName;
    private String instructor;
    private int credits;

    public Course(String courseName, String instructor, int credits) {
        this.courseName = courseName;
        this.instructor = instructor;
        this.credits = credits;
    }

    // Display course details
    public void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Course Name: " + courseName);
        System.out.println("Instructor: " + instructor);
        System.out.println("Credits: " + credits);
    }
}
